# CAPM-
In this project we create a web application using streamlit to perform CAPM calculation for different stocks. We use Yahoo finance to gather data related to different stocks. 
There are two fiels, CAPM.py consists of the main code for fetching the data for the selected stocks, creating the web application using streamlit, calculating CAPM values for different stocks.  

capm_functions consists of some functions that we use to calculate some coefficients like Beta, normlaising the data and plotting it. 

CAPMn or capital asset pricing model is basically used to calculate expected returns given the cost of capital and risk of assets.
